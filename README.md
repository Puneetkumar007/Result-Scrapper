# ResultScraper
A webscraper tool to automate the process of downloading the result of my 6th sem, when uploaded on my college site.
Just Developed it for fun.

It can run infinitely until the result is declared or you can terminate it after running it once.

## How to use?
- **For Android**
  - Download the [main.py](main.py) file.
  - Uncomment the lines which I mentioned in the [main.py](main.py) for text-to-speech functionality.
  - Install QPython3 from Google PlayStore.
  - Place the main.py file in the `/storage/emulated/0/qpython/scripts3/` path.
  - Open QPython3 and click on the bigger QPython3 logo on the screen.
  - Choose `Run local script`.
  - Select `main.py` and it will start executing.
  
   (If any **No module found error**, just run the following command in the console)
   `pip3 install package-name`
  
 - **For other environments**
 
    Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org) and follow the steps mentioned there.
